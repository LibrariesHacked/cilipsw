===========

CILIP in Wales have been compiling a list of libraries (Further Ed, Higher Ed, Health, Public, Research) and loading these in to WikiData so they can be maintained by anybody.

Taking the Wales Library data, this project is designed to list the libraries on the map and also show driving/walking/cycling times at 5 minute intervals around each library.
