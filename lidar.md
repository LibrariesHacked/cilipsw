LIDAR
=====

Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is an airborne mapping technique, which uses a laser to measure the distance between the aircraft and the ground.

[Environment Agency Open data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/lidar-composite-dsm-1m1) includes 'digital elevation data derived from surveys carried out by the Environment Agency's specialist remote sensing team. Accurate elevation data is available for over 70% of England.'

3D buildings
------------

We often have GIS polygon data to represent building 'footprints'. Using LIDAR data we can determine an average height for buildings, which aids in creating 3D maps that display building heights.
