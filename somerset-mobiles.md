Somerset Mobiles
================

**Note: one mobile library no longer exists!**.

Taking open street map route data I wanted to visualise the routes that I would expect mobile libraries to take.

Demo: [Somerset Mobiles](http://somersetmobiles.librarieshacked.org)

It would be interesting to explore this further:

- Track mobile libraries in real time and allow people to 'book' or 'hail' the library en route.
- Use routing data to plot the 'perfect' route that limited travel time.
