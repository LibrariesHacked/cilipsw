Book set in a location
======================

Open Data that includes geography and libraries is always fun!

A web application called [Mappit](https://www.mappit.net/bookmap/#selected=/bookmap/places/90/) creates a 'Global Book Map'.

You can see books published in your local area. Or maybe places your're visiting.

This uses crowdsourced open data from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) and [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/).

Also see [British National Bibliography data](http://bnb.bl.uk) for books published in different locations.
