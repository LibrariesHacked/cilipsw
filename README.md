Why Geography (or GIS)
----------------------

Everything happens somewhere. Geography data is becoming increasingly important, because there is so much we can use from open data *about* locations.  Examples include:

- deprivation statistics and need of areas which include: income, education, work, services;
- population density and rural/urban split;
- number of young/old people;
- government, local government boundaries (and all sorts of other boundaries);
- the history of a place;
- natural environment such as flood plains, climate, and biodiversity.

Not only is geographic intelligence powerful and essential to data analysis, but it is fun!

Location vs. Place
------------------

What is the difference between location and place?  We tend to use *'Location'* when talking about exact defined points or areas.  For example, a local government boundary, or the location of a library.  *'Place'* is usually more indefinable.  It may be 'the North', or 'Abroad', or 'Home'.
