Geographical boundaries in the UK
=================================

The UK has many different geographical boundaries and they are complex!

Many of these are available to download at the ONS Geoportal.

Libraries in the UK are administered by a mix of County Councils, Metropolitan districts, London boroughs, and Unitary authorities.

Area profiling
--------------

Within each authority area there are a number of further geographical areas to split the authority.

| Area type | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Census** | Base unit areas called 'Output Areas' make up the ONS statistical 'Super Output Areas' released at two hierarchichal levels: Lower (contain ~1500 people) and Medium (contain ~7500 people).  These are designed to fit within administrative, ward, and parish boundaries and are very useful for local government.  Statistical data are released for these areas such as deprivation, age ranges, and ethnicity. |
| **Postcode** | Postcode geographies are at Area, District, Sector, and Unit level.  For example, the Somerset Postcode Unit **TA1 3XZ** is in the **TA** Area, the **TA1** District, and the **TA1 3** Sector. |

So, what associated data can be gained from using these area definitions? A few are shown below.

| Data | Area | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| **Deprivation Indices** | LSOA | The 2015 deprivation indices are comparative levels of deprivation for all Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in England.  These are by deprivation type, for example health, education, and income.  An index of multiple deprivation (IMD) summarises all deprivation types to produce an overall ranking.  The 32,844 ranked areas are then split into deciles to give a single 1-10 value for each area (1 being within the most deprived, 10 within the least). |
| **Estimated population** | LSOA | Annual mid-year population estimates are released by the ONS, broken down by age and gender and released at Lower Super Output Level. |
| **Rural/Urban** | Output Area | There are classifications of each area of 'rurality' ranging from 'Major Conurbation' to 'Hamlets and Isolated Dwellings in a Sparse Setting' |
