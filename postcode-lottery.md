Postcode lottery
================

One difficulty in assessing locations of libraries is procimity is more important in some areas than others.

- People in very rural areas don't necessarily expect very **close** access to a library (though they should have access to library services).
- People in urban areas may expect a library to be part of the immediate services in their town/city.

Taking data from urban/rural classifications this projects converts a postcode to an Output area, and then assesses the distance to a library compared to areas in the same rural/urban category.
