## Geographic coordinate systems

Wikipedia: [Geographic coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system)

*A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on the Earth to be specified by a set of numbers or letters, or symbols...A common choice of coordinates is latitude, longitude and elevation.*

| Coordinate type |  X  |  Y  |
| --------------- | --- | --- |
| Longitude and Latitude. | -3.106849 | 51.015344 |
| Eastings and Northings. | 322454 | 124580 |

## Points, lines, and polygons

Typically when dealing with geo-spatial data, this will be in the form of Points, Lines, and Polygons.

- **Points** - Individual locations made up of a single coordinate set e.g. a Library.
- **Lines** - Linear features made up of coordinates e.g. a Road
- **Polygons** - Bounded areas (shapes) made up of coordinates e.g. a County Council.

## Geocoding and reverse-geocoding

Geocoding and reverse geocoding are ways of matching address and location data with geo-coordinates.

- **Geocoding:** Address -> Geo-coordinates.  Example: Putting a library on a map from it's address.
- **Reverse geocoding:** Geo-coordinates -> Address.  Example: taking coordinates retrieved from GPS to determine current location.

## GIS software

The traditional way of working with GIS data is through Desktop applications

- [ESRI ArcDesktop](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop) - World leader for GIS software
- [MapInfo](http://www.pitneybowes.com/us/location-intelligence/geographic-information-systems/mapinfo-pro.html) - Acquired by Pitney Bowes Business Insight
- [Quantum GIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/) - Open Source option.  Brilliant.
