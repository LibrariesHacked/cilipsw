Plymouth 3D
===========

The company [Emu Analytics](http://buildingheights.emu-analytics.net/) used LIDAR data to create 3D building data for across the UK. 

These are not all made available as open data but a select number of cities have been made available.

One of these was Plymouth.

Plymouth release open data on the locations of libraries (and opening hours, and services offered), available at [Plymouth Open data](https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/libraries/contactlibraryservice/librarydata).

Library Finder
--------------

Taking the 3D building data, the Plymouth Library Finder project is designed to highlight the library building rather than put points on a map. And use the opening hours and services to provide some interactive functionality.
