Plymouth 3D
===========

The company [Emu Analytics](http://buildingheights.emu-analytics.net/) used LIDAR data to create 3D building data for across the UK. 

These are not all made available as open data but select cities have been made available.

One of these was Plymouth.

Plymouth release open data on the locations of libraries, available at [Plymouth Open data](https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/libraries/contactlibraryservice/librarydata).

Library Finder
--------------

Taking the 3D building data I wanted to create a library finder tha highlighted the library building rather than put points on a map.
