Libraries England
=================

Using the Libraries Taskforce [Libraries in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-libraries-in-england-basic-dataset) dataset I plotted all libraries in a dashboard to explore different aspect of their location. Including:

- Percentage of the population within certain distances
- Estimated catchment areas of the libraries, and the profile of the population within that catchment
- Comparisons between authorities such as number of libraries relative to area, or relative to population
